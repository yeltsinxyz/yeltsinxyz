Hello everyone, nice to meet you. My name is Yeltsin Lima. I am a front-end developer who is currently learning back-end and also software development. I also trying to create some nice open-source things. Currently I'm working on a theme for my "company" (isn't really a company, because I'm the only one who works there, for now...) called [Crema](https://github.com/yeltsinxyz/crema). I'm also working on an application to help people with anxiety track they crisis based in the CBT therapy method. Since it's an app, I'm also learning Flutter :heart:.
